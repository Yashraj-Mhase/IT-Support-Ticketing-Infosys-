# IT Support Ticketing – Data Analysis Project #

Infosys Springboard Internship 2026
1️⃣ Problem Statement

The objective of this project is to analyze IT support ticket data to identify key performance trends, optimize resolution times, and enhance overall service efficiency using data analytics and visualization.

The project aims to uncover patterns in customer requests, technical issues, and support performance metrics to recommend improvements in workflow efficiency and resource allocation for IT support teams.

2️⃣ Project Description

Supportlytics is a data visualization and analytics project focused on IT support operations. The project analyzes historical IT support ticket data to understand ticket behavior across priorities, categories, countries, and clusters.

The analysis involves:

Data acquisition and preprocessing

Feature engineering to derive performance metrics

Exploratory data analysis (EDA)

Similarity and cluster-based analysis

Visualization through dashboards and reports

The final outcome is a data-driven performance dashboard and analytical report that provides actionable insights to improve IT support effectiveness.

3️⃣ Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)

The following KPIs are used to evaluate IT support performance:

Average Resolution Time

Ticket Volume by Priority

Ticket Distribution by Category

Resolution Efficiency

Cluster Similarity Score

High-Priority Unresolved Tickets

Top Performing Regions / Countries

Cluster-wise Resolution Rate

4️⃣ Dashboards

📊 Dashboards Created Using Power BI

The dashboards visualize:

Ticket distribution by category, priority, and country

Resolution efficiency across priorities

Geographic trends using maps

Performance comparison across regions and teams

👉 Upload Power BI dashboard files (.pbix) and screenshots in this section of the repository.
